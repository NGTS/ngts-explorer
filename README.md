# Interesting lightcurves

Anders has asked for some nice lightcurves to use for a poster. Try and find some nice objects to get lightcurves of

## Usage

Coming soon!

## Todo

* Add ability to search by object identifier
  * `NGTSExplorer` can have `#show_object` method which shows a particular object by (fuzzy?) name
  * when building the mapping object, store the mapping from object name to identifier
    * then just call the standard api
    * when given the name, look up the object id and plot to screen
  * perhaps add fuzzy searching
* flesh out the way to plot all objects in a class and save chosen ones
  * perhaps some form of ui in which the user can save the image
